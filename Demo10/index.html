		<title>CSS Blocks Revisited</title>

	<body>
		<p style="display:inline;">		
			<a class="popup" href="http://localhost/htmlcss/demo10/index.html">display: block<span>
				 Means that the element is displayed as a block, as paragraphs and headers have always 
				 been. A block has some whitespace above and below it and tolerates no HTML elements 
				 next to it, except when ordered otherwise (by adding a float declaration to another 
				 element, for instance).</span>
			</a>
		</p >
		<p style="display:inline;">		
			<a class="popup" href="http://localhost/htmlcss/demo10/index.html">display: inline<span>
				  means that the element is displayed inline, inside the current block on the same line. 
				  Only when it's between two blocks does the element form an 'anonymous block', that 
				  however has the smallest possible width.</span>
			</a>
		</p>
		<p id="fix">
			<a class="popup" href="http://localhost/htmlcss/demo10/index.html">Fixed Block<span>
				A fixed position element is positioned relative to the viewport, or the browser window itself. 
				The viewport doesn't change when the window is scrolled, so a fixed positioned element will stay 
				right where it is when the page is scrolled, creating an effect a bit like the old school "frames" 
				days.</span>
			</a>
		</p>
		<p id="rel">
			<a class="popup" href="http://localhost/htmlcss/demo10/index.html">Relative Block<span>
				If you set position: relative; on an element but no other positioning attributes (top, left, bottom or right), 
				it will have no effect on it's positioning at all, it will be exactly as it would be if you left it as 
				position: static; But if you DO give it some other positioning attribute, say, top: 10px;, 
				it will shift it's position 10 pixels DOWN from where it would NORMALLY be.</span>
			</a>
		</p>
		<p id="abs">
			<a class="popup" href="http://localhost/htmlcss/demo10/index.html">Absolute Block<span>
				This is a very powerful type of positioning that allows you to literally place any page element exactly 
				where you want it. You use the positioning attributes top, left bottom and right to set the location. 
				Remember that these values will be relative to the next parent element with relative (or absolute) 
				positioning. If there is no such parent, it will default all the way back up to the <html> element 
				itself meaning it will be placed relatively to the page itself. </span>
			</a>
